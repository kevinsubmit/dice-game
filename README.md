# Dice Game

## Project Description 

The Dice Game is a simple yet engaging game that typically involves one or more players rolling dice to determine outcomes based on the numbers rolled. Players are rolling a standard six-sided die (or multiple dice) and may compete to achieve the highest score, match specific combinations, or complete certain objectives
